# Google-Book-Search
This is a MERN app made with React.
This app searches for books on google book search api and lists them for user to view detailed information.

# Additional work
1. Currently the tertiary function to change the label of the buttons is not working.
2. The save function to save a library of chosen books is faulty.
3. When nothing is inputed application currently still searches for "undefined" this needs to change to generate a error message to the user indicating nothing was searched.
